# Part 1

## Impressions

This seems like it might be something that could be easily solvable with a graph... Like, surrealdb.

If I parse the data into a graph, I can then query it to find the answer.

I could also just create maps of each relationship, but this may be simpler with surrealdb - and a good excuse to use it!
