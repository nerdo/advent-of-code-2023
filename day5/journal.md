# Part 1

## Impressions

This seems like it might be something that could be easily solvable with a graph... Like, surrealdb.

If I parse the data into a graph, I can then query it to find the answer.

I could also just create maps of each relationship, but this may be simpler with surrealdb - and a good excuse to use it!

## Problems

I should have read the directions more thoroughly!

I thought I understood the ask but I missed the part about how any source numbers that aren't mapped correspond to the same destination number.

I also didn't fully read through the walkthrough of the solution and i botched it up, going down a rabbit hole and tinkering with surrealdb, which was a good exercise if it wasn't a complete waste of time for this challenge.

...back to the drawing board!
